It's been a surprisingly quiet week for big Go related news, but we have quite a lot of code links for you - find them at the bottom of this issue :-)

If you have any Go articles or projects we should consider for a future issue, hit 'reply' to this newsletter, and send them in. We read all submissions and most make it into an issue.
